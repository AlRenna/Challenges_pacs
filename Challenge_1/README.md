### Team members:

Galati Stefano stefano1.galati@mail.polimi.it

Marzotto Mattia mattia.marzotto@mail.polimi.it

Renna Alessandro alessandro1.renna@mail.polimit.it

### Execution:

The make command has 3 functions: all (default), clean, distclean.

make all creates two executables: main and main_muparser: (the only difference is how input data is defined).

make clean and make distclean are cleanup commands.

Using the Visualize.py file provided during the lab session, and modified by us, you can get the plot of both executables.
